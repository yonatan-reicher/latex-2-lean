# Meeting with Shachar

This project will have the goal of letting users get useful and well-typed Lean
definitions from their pure-math definitions.

How do we achieve this goal? We let users input Markdown+Latex to describe
their proofs. Our language will be a subset of Markdown+Latex. The users will
have to conform to this subset.


I suggested that we should start with small examples. Shachar said something
different - and probably correct - our example is already small enough, and we
want to push for fast iteration and failure. Because of that, our `proof.md` is
the perfect target (in terms of what we should support).


Shachar said that each definition could have a number of possible Lean
definitions. Of that, our program should (internally) describe a way to generate
every single definition. Then, it should generate some best one.


## Goals For This Week

Make a Lean Abstract Syntax Tree - and generate some different Lean definitions
from some one math definition.


## Unrelated

We agreed that working on making a different theorem prover is not of interest.
Reasons:
1. Out of our development-budget.
2. We want to expand the Lean Ecosystem.
